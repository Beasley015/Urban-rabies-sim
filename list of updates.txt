X Add proportionally higher juvenile mortality when carrying capacity is reached
X Immigrants skew young
- Split movement and disease functions
X Remove landscape barriers
- Pivot to immigration questions
- Add variation in home range size
X Decrease carrying capacity slightly
X Change ORV function so landscape buffer has vaccination rate of 60%
