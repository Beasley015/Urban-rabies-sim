Planned updates to ABM: (X = complete)

X Figure out correct timing for birth, juvenile dispersal, and ORV
X Add proportionally higher juvenile mortality when carrying capacity is reached
X Immigrants skew young
X Split movement and disease functions
X Add lower infection rate to raccoons in home range, but not in current cell
X Remove landscape barriers
X Pivot to immigration questions
X Decrease carrying capacity slightly
X Change ORV function so landscape buffer has vaccination rate of 60%
X Fix immigration so they can't be both vaccinated and infected
X Fix issue where immigrants can immediately leave the landscape
X Reduce dispersal distance
X Optimize for speed
X Add option to leave incubation stage and survive w/low probability
X Check McClure habitat type designations in supplemental material
X Make figures for Nov. 12 meeting
X Add conspecific avoidance to movement (adults only)
X add adult dispersal
X Adjust distance decay rate
X Adjust landscape clustering to create larger clusters

Parameter sensitivity analyses:
X Max carrying capacity (sans rabies, look at July & October pop size)
X Crowding mortality rates (sans rabies)
X Disease transmission rates
X Gif of disease spread from year 6/7 onwards
X Look at home ranges based on habitat in home range center
X Make sure latent period is where it should be
X Make sure recovery rates are where they should be

X Run it!

Results:
- Create draft figures

Writing:
X Read USDA internal report
X Read Grimm et al. 2006 & 2010 for standard protocol to document ABMs
X Add variable params to main table
- Don't label raccoons as juvenile, etc., instead use "raccoons over x weeks old 
	can do y"
- Will need to be clear that I'm using population-level RSF, which removes
	the individual variation seen in real life
- Write Appendix 1 (full ODD protocol)
- Write Appendix 2 (model testing and parameter sensitivity)
