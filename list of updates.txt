Planned updates to ABM: (X = complete)

X Figure out correct timing for birth, juvenile dispersal, and ORV
X Add proportionally higher juvenile mortality when carrying capacity is reached
X Immigrants skew young
X Split movement and disease functions
X Add lower infection rate to raccoons in home range, but not in current cell
X Remove landscape barriers
X Pivot to immigration questions
X Decrease carrying capacity slightly
X Change ORV function so landscape buffer has vaccination rate of 60%
X Fix immigration so they can't be both vaccinated and infected
X Fix issue where immigrants can immediately leave the landscape
X Reduce dispersal distance
- Change density mortality to gamma dist. that changes with # of raccoons
- Optimize for speed


Parameter sensitivity analyses:
- Crowding mortality rates (sans rabies)
- Disease transmission rates

Writing:
X Read USDA internal report
- Read Grimm et al. 2006 & 2010 for standard protocol to document ABMs
