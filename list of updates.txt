Planned updates to ABM: (X = complete)

X Figure out correct timing for birth, juvenile dispersal, and ORV
X Add proportionally higher juvenile mortality when carrying capacity is reached
X Immigrants skew young
X Split movement and disease functions
X Add lower infection rate to raccoons in home range, but not in current cell
X Remove landscape barriers
X Pivot to immigration questions
X Decrease carrying capacity slightly
X Change ORV function so landscape buffer has vaccination rate of 60%
X Fix immigration so they can't be both vaccinated and infected
X Fix issue where immigrants can immediately leave the landscape
X Reduce dispersal distance
X Optimize for speed
X Add option to leave incubation stage and survive w/low probability
X Check McClure habitat type designations in supplemental material
X Make figures for Nov. 12 meeting
X Add conspecific avoidance to movement (adults only)
X add adult dispersal
X Adjust distance decay rate

Parameter sensitivity analyses:
- Max carrying capacity (sans rabies, look at July & October pop size)
- Crowding mortality rates (sans rabies)
- Disease transmission rates
- Gif of disease spread from year 6/7 onwards
X Look at home ranges based on habitat in home range center
X Make sure latent period is where it should be
X Make sure recovery rates are where they should be

- Run it!

Writing:
X Read USDA internal report
- Read Grimm et al. 2006 & 2010 for standard protocol to document ABMs
