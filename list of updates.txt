Planned updates to ABM: (X = complete)

X Figure out correct timing for birth, juvenile dispersal, and ORV
X Add proportionally higher juvenile mortality when carrying capacity is reached
X Immigrants skew young
X Split movement and disease functions
- Add lower infection rate to raccoons in home range, but not in current cell
X Remove landscape barriers
- Pivot to immigration questions
X Decrease carrying capacity slightly
X Change ORV function so landscape buffer has vaccination rate of 60%
X Fix immigration so they can't be both vaccinated and infected
X Fix issue where immigrants can immediately leave the landscape
